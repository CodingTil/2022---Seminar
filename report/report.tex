\section{Introduction}
Introduce the best topic ever properly.

\section{My Fancy Second Section}
My second section is even better than the first one\footnote{Proof omitted.} because it contains a footnote as well as some citations~\cite{Squarepants03,Knuth97}.
Everything else is explained in Figure~\ref{fig:dummy}. Always make sure that all figures are referenced.
